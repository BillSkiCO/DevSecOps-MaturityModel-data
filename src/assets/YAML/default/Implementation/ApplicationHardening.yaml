        To tackle the security of code developed in-house, OWASP offers an extensive collection of [Cheatsheets](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/) demonstrating how to implement features securely. Moreover, the Security Knowledge Framework[1] offers an extensive library of code patterns spanning several programming languages. These patterns can be used to not only jumpstart the development process, but also do so securely.

        [...]

        ### Planning aka Requirements Gathering & Analysis
        The Requirements gathering process tries to answer the question: _"What is the system going to do?"_ At this stage, the [SAMM project](https://owaspsamm.org/model/) offers 3 distinct maturity levels covering both [in-house](https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/stream-a/) software development and [third party](https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/stream-b/) supplier security.

        ![SAMM Requirements](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-integration-standards/raw/master/writeups/owasp_in_sdlc/images/OWASP-in0.png)

        Organizations can use these to add solid security considerations at the start of the Software Development or Procurement process.

        These general security considerations can be audited by using a subsection of the ASVS controls in section V1 as a questionnaire. This process attempts to ensure that every feature has concrete security considerations.

        In case of internal development and if the organization maps Features to Epics, the [Security Knowledge Framework](https://securityknowledgeframework.org/) can be used to facilitate this process by leveraging its questionnaire function, shown below.
