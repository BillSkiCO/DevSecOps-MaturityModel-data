  Test KPI:
    #Number of vulnerabilities - appsec - vuln management ?
    Number of vulnerabilities/severity:
      uuid: bc548cba-cb82-4f76-bd4b-325d9d256279
      risk: |-
        Failing to convey the number of vulnerabilities by severity might undermine the effectiveness of product teams. This might lead to ignorance of findings.
      measure: |-
        Measurement and communication of vulnerabilities per severity for components like applications. At least quarterly.
      description: |-
        Communication can be performed in a simple way, e.g. text based during the build process.
        This activity depends on at least one security testing implementation.

    SLA per criticality:

      risk: |-
        Not communicating how many applications are adhering to SLAs based on the criticality of vulnerabilities can lead to delayed remediation of 
        critical security issues, increasing the risk of exploitation and potential damage to the organization.
      measure: |-
        Measurement and communication of how much vulnerabilities handling per severity for components like applications are aligned to SLAs. 
        At least quarterly.
